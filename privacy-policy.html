    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pocket Words</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: March 1, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Pocket Words ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>Pocket Words is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data required to provide our service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Words you save to your word list</li>
        <li>App usage information (features used, performance data)</li>
        <li>Device information (device model, operating system version)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google Account Information</h2>
    <p>If you choose to enable Google Drive sync, we request access to your Google account for the sole purpose of saving and retrieving your word list data. We only access files created by our app in your Google Drive.</p>
    <p>You can disable this integration at any time through the app Settings.</p>

    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase Analytics to collect information about how users interact with the app. This helps us improve the app experience. This information is anonymized and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>Crash Reports</h2>
    <p>We use Firebase Crashlytics to collect crash reports when the app experiences errors. These reports help us identify and fix issues. Crash reports contain technical information about your device and the circumstances of the crash, but no personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your word list is stored locally on your device. If you enable Google Drive sync, it will also be stored in your personal Google Drive account. We do not have access to this data unless you explicitly share it with us for support purposes.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date".</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
